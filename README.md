# Fuel Rate Prediction using Blast Furnace Operational Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the fuel rate (in kg/thm) in blast furnace operation, a key performance indicator that significantly impacts both cost and environmental sustainability. The analysis uses a dataset containing critical blast furnace parameters such as:

- Moisture content
- CO efficiency
- Hot blast temperature
- Slag rate
- Flame temperature
- Top pressure

The project involves data cleaning, outlier removal, data visualization, model training, and evaluation using various regression algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – data handling and preprocessing
- Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly – data visualization
- Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation
- Joblib – model saving and loading

## Data Preprocessing

1. Renamed inconsistent column headers.
2. Converted values to numeric types.
3. Removed missing values.
4. Applied IQR method to remove outliers using the 30th–70th percentile range.

## 📈 Data Visualization

- Correlation heatmap using Plotly
- Scatter plots with OLS trendlines between each feature and fuel rate
- Feature importance bar plot

- Best performing model: Random Forest Regressor

## Results

- Evaluation based on R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visual comparison of model performance using bar plot

## Prediction

Interactive user input allows prediction of the fuel rate based on new values of input parameters.

## Model Deployment

- Trained Random Forest model saved as: `fuel_rate_rf_model.pkl`
- Ready for integration into web dashboards, APIs, or desktop GUIs.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Place your dataset as `blastfurnacedata.csv` in the same directory.
3. Run `fuel_rate_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
4. Follow the instructions for entering new values and getting predictions.
